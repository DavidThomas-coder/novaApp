# HubSpot CRM Integration

## Overview

Integrating HubSpot CRM with your Nova Analytics Dashboard would provide powerful cross-platform insights by combining Eventbrite ticket data with HubSpot contact and deal data.

## Potential Benefits

### 1. **Enhanced Customer Profiles**
- Match Eventbrite attendees with HubSpot contacts
- Enrich contact records with event attendance history
- Track which contacts are customers vs. just leads

### 2. **Marketing Attribution**
- See which marketing campaigns drive ticket sales
- Track email campaign effectiveness
- Measure ROI on marketing spend

### 3. **Customer Journey Tracking**
- Map the path from lead â†’ first ticket â†’ repeat customer
- Identify drop-off points in the funnel
- Understand conversion rates

### 4. **Automated Workflows**
- Auto-tag HubSpot contacts when they buy tickets
- Trigger follow-up emails to new attendees
- Create lists of repeat customers for special offers

### 5. **Revenue Reconciliation**
- Compare Eventbrite gross revenue with actual deposits
- Track payment processing fees
- Calculate true net revenue after all costs

## Technical Implementation

### HubSpot API Setup

1. **Get API Key**:
   - Go to HubSpot Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Private Apps
   - Create a new private app with these scopes:
     - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
     - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
     - `crm.objects.deals.read`
     - `analytics.behavioral_events.send`

2. **Backend Endpoints to Add**:

```python
@app.route('/api/hubspot/sync-contacts', methods=['POST'])
def sync_contacts():
    """Sync Eventbrite attendees to HubSpot contacts"""
    # Match emails from Eventbrite to HubSpot
    # Update contact properties with event attendance
    # Tag contacts with "Nova Attendee"
    pass

@app.route('/api/hubspot/customer-360', methods=['GET'])
def get_customer_360():
    """Get complete customer view from both systems"""
    # Combine Eventbrite attendance + HubSpot deal data
    # Show complete customer journey
    pass
```

### 3. **New Dashboard Features**

**Customer 360 View**:
- Show HubSpot contact data alongside Eventbrite data
- Display deal stage, lifecycle stage, last contact date
- Show email engagement metrics

**Marketing Dashboard**:
- Track campaign performance
- Show which sources drive most ticket sales
- Calculate customer acquisition cost

**Funnel Analysis**:
- Lead â†’ Contact â†’ First Ticket â†’ Repeat Customer
- Conversion rates at each stage
- Time to conversion metrics

## Data Matching Strategy

### Primary Match: Email Address
```python
def match_customer(eventbrite_email):
    # Search HubSpot for contact with matching email
    hubspot_contact = hubspot_api.get_contact_by_email(email)
    
    if hubspot_contact:
        # Update with Eventbrite data
        return merge_data(hubspot_contact, eventbrite_data)
    else:
        # Create new contact in HubSpot
        return create_hubspot_contact(eventbrite_data)
```

### Custom Properties to Add in HubSpot:
- `nova_events_attended` (number)
- `nova_last_event_date` (date)
- `nova_first_event_date` (date)
- `nova_total_spend` (number)
- `nova_customer_type` (enum: New, Returning, VIP)

## Cost Tracking Enhancement

With HubSpot integration, you could also track:

### Expenses in HubSpot Deals:
- Room rental costs
- Marketing spend
- Production costs
- Staff/performer costs

### Net Revenue Calculation:
```
Net Revenue = Gross Revenue (Eventbrite) - Expenses (HubSpot)
Net Margin = (Net Revenue / Gross Revenue) * 100
```

### New Dashboard Metrics:
- Net revenue per event
- Profit margin by show type
- Marketing ROI
- Cost per attendee acquired

## Implementation Complexity

### Easy (1-2 days):
- Basic contact sync (email matching)
- Add HubSpot data to customer cards
- Simple property updates

### Medium (3-5 days):
- Full bidirectional sync
- Marketing attribution
- Automated workflows
- Deal tracking integration

### Advanced (1-2 weeks):
- Complete customer journey tracking
- Predictive lead scoring
- Automated email campaigns
- Revenue reconciliation dashboard

## Recommended First Steps

1. **Start with Read-Only Integration**:
   - Fetch HubSpot contact data
   - Display alongside Eventbrite data
   - Don't write back to HubSpot yet

2. **Add Customer Enrichment View**:
   - New tab showing matched customers
   - Side-by-side comparison of both systems
   - Identify gaps and duplicates

3. **Then Add Write Operations**:
   - Sync attendance data to HubSpot
   - Create contacts for new attendees
   - Update deal values with ticket revenue

## API Rate Limits

**HubSpot Limits**:
- Free tier: 100 requests per 10 seconds
- Starter: 150 requests per 10 seconds  
- Professional: 200 requests per 10 seconds

Much more generous than Eventbrite! Less likely to hit rate limits.

## Would You Like to Implement This?

If yes, I can:
1. Add HubSpot API integration to the backend
2. Create a new "Customer 360" tab
3. Add expense tracking for net revenue calculations
4. Build marketing attribution dashboard

This would make your analytics platform even more powerful and give you a complete view of your business! ðŸš€
